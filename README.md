# Task-1-GRIP
Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning.
The aim is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. 
We are provided with the data of 24 students, given the number of study hours and marks obtained. (the study hours is the explanatory variable and the marks obtained is the response variable.)
On the given data, we apply regression analysis. We fit the regression model and find the regression coefficients by the use of OLS() funtion from the statsmodel Library.
By the use of the regression equation, we predict the marks of the student who studies for 9.25 hours a day.
